# GA-Project2 Recipe App

This application represents use of the technologies and techniques learned during unit 2. I am building a front-end recipe application using React. Recipe Puppy is primarily a search site. I am Inspired by the Taste of Home website:
https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/

Project Description:
The application should retrieve data from the http://www.recipepuppy.com/ site using its api and render it in a browser.

Project Link:
GitHub- https://github.com/grimmana/GA-Project2-React
Deployment - 

Wireframe: https://wireframe.cc/S7wxhm - diagram broke. Uploaded a screen shot to my GitHub page: https://github.com/grimmana/GA-Project2-React/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-05%20at%2011.30.40%20AM.png  takes a really long time to load.

MVP:
1. Find and use external api.
2. Render data on page
3. Allow user to interact with the page

Post MVP:
1. Pull additional data

				
Components:

Component			Description
App				This makes initial data pull
Header			This will render the header and include the nav
Footer			This will render the header and include the nav

Time Frames:

How I built it:
test
 1. Setup a new repository on my Git Hub site.
 2. Cloned the repository to my local machine.
 3. Setup a separate test folder on my computer to test bringing in the api. Not necessary.
 4. ❯ npx create-react-app appname         (appname = the folder to be created)
 5. ❯ cd appname
 6. ❯ npm start                            (verify the spinning React logo)
 7. Browser open in Chrome: View | Developer | Developer Tools

Project setup:

1. Setup a new repository on my Git Hub site.
2. Clone the repository link https://github.com/grimmana/GA-Project2-React.git to ~ sei/projects/ on the local machine.
3. From the github folder [GA-Projext2-React]; run the command replacing appname with desired folder name [recipes]
	- npx 
	- ❯ npx create-react-app appname
	- ~ sei/projects/GA-Project2-React/recipes
4. From the appname folder; run the command to install axios for api calls
	- npm 
	- ❯ npm install axios	
5. From the appname folder; run the command to install the React-Router package
	- npm 
	- ❯ npm install react-router react-router-dom
6. Start the server; 
	- ❯ npm start
	- may initially receive a prompt to start Chrome so the Server Web page can be displayed
	- check the web page for the spinning React logo
	 to test the website API us
	 ing Postman.

Accomplishments I am proud of:

What I learned:
1. Working with wireframe software. 
2. Other ways of editing a markdown document
3. Uploading files to github.
1. The importance of CORS to the web development process by specifying who and how assets can be accessed. 
	- Chrome extension that bypasses the error, but only works in development and causes some sites to not render properly or videos to load.
	- Heroku link
2. Adjusting the size of an image.
